        <p class="general-information band-info">Alice in Chains (often abbreviated as AIC) is an American rock band from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1987
            by guitarist and vocalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Cantrell" target="_blank">Jerry
                Cantrell</a> and drummer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Kinney" target="_blank">Sean
                Kinney</a>, who later recruited bassist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Starr_(musician)"
                target="_blank">Mike Starr</a> and
            lead vocalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layne_Staley" target="_blank">Layne Staley</a>. Starr
            was replaced by <a hreflang="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Inez" target="_blank">Mike Inez</a> in 1993. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_DuVall"
                target="_blank">William DuVall</a> joined the band in 2006
            as co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, replacing Staley, who died in 2002. The band took its name from
            Staley's previous group, the glam metal band Alice N' Chains.
            Often associated with grunge music, Alice in Chains' sound incorporates heavy metal elements. The band is
            known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals between Staley and
            Cantrell (and later Cantrell and DuVall). Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on the 1992 acoustic
            EP Sap, and his role continued to grow in the following albums, making Alice in Chains a two-vocal
            band.

            Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with
            other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. They achieved success during the era with
            the albums Facelift (1990), Dirt (1992), Alice in Chains (1995), as well as the EP Jar of Flies (1994).
            Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onward,
            due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band regrouped in 2006, with
            DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time, and they have since released three more albums: Black
            Gives Way to Blue (2009), The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here (2013), and Rainier Fog (2018).
