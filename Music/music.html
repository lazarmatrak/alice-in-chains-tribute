                        Cantrell sings lead vocals in an Alice in Chains release, with the song "Brother". The EP was

                        later after being featured on the soundtrack to the 1994 film Clerks. On January 14, 1994, Sap

                        Dirt is the second studio album by the American rock band Alice in Chains, released on September
                        29,
                        1992, through Columbia Records. Peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 chart, the album was also
                        well
                        received by music critics. It has since been certified four-times platinum by the RIAA and gone
                        on to
                        sell five million copies worldwide, making Dirt the band's highest selling album to date. It is
                        the
                        band's last album recorded with all four original members, as bassist Mike Starr was fired from
                        the band
                        in January 1993. The album spawned five singles: "Would?", "Them Bones", "Angry Chair",
                        "Rooster", and "Down in a Hole"; all with accompanying music videos. Dirt was nominated for a
                        Grammy
                        Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. The music video for "Would?" was nominated for an MTV
                        Video Music
                        Award for Best Video from a Film, as the song was featured on the soundtrack to Cameron Crowe's
                        1992
                        film Singles.

                        The songs on the album focused on depression, pain, anger, anti-social behavior, relationships,
                        drug
                        addiction (primarily heroin), war, death, and other emotionally charged topics. The track "Iron
                        Gland"
                        features Tom Araya from Slayer on vocals. Most of the music from the album was written by
                        guitarist
                        Jerry Cantrell, but for the first time vocalist Layne Staley wrote two songs by himself: "Hate
                        to Feel"
                        and "Angry Chair", both also feature Staley on guitar.

                        Alice in Chains (occasionally informally referred to as The Dog Album, The Dog Record, and
                        Tripod) is the self-titled third studio album by the American rock band Alice in Chains. It was
                        released on November 7, 1995 through Columbia Records, and was the follow-up to the highly
                        successful
                        Dirt (1992). This is the band's first full-length studio album to feature bassist Mike Inez;
                        their last
                        album to feature original lead vocalist Layne Staley, who died in 2002; and their last album to
                        be
                        released on Columbia Records. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and stayed on the
                        chart
                        for 46 weeks. The tracks "Grind", "Heaven Beside You" and "Again" were released as singles.
                        "Grind"
                        and "Again" were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. The album
                        received
                        double platinum certification from the RIAA and has sold over three million copies worldwide.
                        The
                        mockumentary The Nona Tapes was released to promote the album and became a cult hit.

                        As with their previous releases, the album's songs focus on heavy subject matter such as
                        depression,
                        isolation, drug use, relationships, anger and death.

                        released on May 28, 2013 through Capitol Records (and the band's final album released by the
                        label).
                        It is the band's second reunion album. Following a worldwide tour in support of its previous
                        album,
                        Black Gives Way to Blue (2009), Alice in Chains began work on a new album. The making of The
                        Devil Put
                        Dinosaurs Here lasted for more than a year and the release of the album was delayed numerous
                        times. The
                        band entered the studio in July 2011 to start work on their fifth album. During the writing and
                        recording sessions, guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell underwent shoulder surgery, which
                        resulted in
                        the delay of the album. The recording sessions of The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here were completed in
                        December 2012.
